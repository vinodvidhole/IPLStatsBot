## About the App
The IPL Stats Bot is an advanced chatbot that offers immediate access to custom relational SQL data. It is developed using state-of-the-art technologies such as Azure OpenAI, Python, LangChain, and Streamlit.

## Overcoming Limitations
Conventional open AI models, including large language models (LLMs), often fall short in delivering real-time answers for the latest events or custom data queries. To address this limitation, our application was designed. We offer OpenAI models access to IPL data in SQL format through LangChain, enabling these models to provide highly accurate responses to specific questions without requiring prior knowledge of the database structure.

## Natural Language to SQL
Additionally, the application showcases Natural Language to SQL conversion, eliminating the need for SQL expertise to gain data insights from relational databases.

## How to Use
To engage with this chatbot, simply ask IPL-related questions for IPL 2023 stats, such as the winner, top run-scorer, leading wicket-taker, or the player with the most Man of the Match awards.
